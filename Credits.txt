Thank you Brigham Keys (Bkeys) for inspiring me, and for answering all my questions.
    (He wanted me to put in a shout out to Brother Helphridge, who inspired him.)

Thank you to Brandon Sanderson, for amongst obvious reasons, creating incredible art and inspiring me in every way possible.

And thank you to my amazing parents, who I love.
